\f0\b Superclass: Magnitude\

\f1\b0 \
Infinitum has a single instance named 
\f0\b inf
\f1\b0  and is used to represent an infinite \
number of iterations. It also responds to comparison operations.\
Infinitum is defined to be greater than all SImpleNumbers.\
It is \ul not\ulnone  meant as a general mathematical infinity value.\
\

\f0\b\fs28 \ul Instance Methods\

\fs24 \ulnone \
do(func)
\f1\b0 \
\
Will iterate the function an infinite number of times. This is only safe to do in a Routine where\
you yield from within the do Function. Otherwise you have a real infinite loop.\
\

\f0\b min(aNumber)\

\f1\b0 \
The minimum of any number and Infinitum is the number.\
\

\f0\b max(aNumber)\

\f1\b0 \
The maximum of any number and Infinitum is 
\f0\b inf
\f1\b0 .\
\

\f0\b < aNumber\
<= aNumber\

\f1\b0 \
Always false.\
\

\f0\b > aNumber\
>= aNumber\

\f1\b0 \
Always true.\

$Id"
------------------------------------------------------------------------

installation (default)
-----------------------

by default emacs-lisp files are installed in

    $prefix/share/emacs/site-lisp

SuperCollider files are put in

    $prefix/share/SuperCollider/Extensions/scel

the only thing you need to do is loading the sclang interface in your
~/.emacs:

    (require 'sclang)

installation (detailed)
------------------------

put all *.el files in emacs' load-path. e.g. if you put them in
~/emacs/, add the following lines to ~/.emacs (or whatever your init
file is called):

(add-to-list 'load-path "~/emacs")

and then load the library:

(require 'sclang)

now put all *.sc files in sclang's library path, e.g. if you put them
in a non-standard location, such as ~/SuperCollider/Emacs/, add the
following to ~/.sclang.cfg:

+~/SuperCollider/Emacs

usage
------

in order to automatically start sclang when invoking emacs, use the
following command line:

$ emacs -sclang

you're now ready to edit, inspect and execute sclang code!

getting help
-------------

inside an sclang-mode buffer (e.g. by editing a .sc file), execute

C-h m

a window with key bindings in sclang-mode will pop up.

customization
--------------

to fine-tune the installation from within emacs' graphical
customization interface, type

M-x sclang-customize

in particular, you will have to customize `sclang-runtime-directory'
and `sclang-help-directory'.

server control
---------------

in the post buffer window, right-click on the server name; by default
the two servers 'internal' and 'localhost' are available. you will get
a menu with common server control operations.

to select another server, step through the server list by
left-clicking on the server name.

servers instantiated from the language will automatically be available
in the mode line.

INSTALL Psycollider
=========================


As this version of Psycollider is compiled with the MS Visual Studio C++ Express
the included installer vccrt.msi must be executed _before_ Psycollider can be started. 

NOTE: You need to have XP or 2000 with the newest Service Pack to be able to install the msi
(needs MSInstaller 3.1)

Otherwise, it is ready to go..., have fun!

\f0\b\fs48 \cf0 CrucialLibrary
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\
\
This is in transition from the SC2 version.  Certain examples are commented out, meaning that they won't currently work.  As much as possible, complete compatibility with sc2 crucial stuff is being maintained.\
\
\
This library offers:\
\
	complete compatibility with any and all Examples and other code libraries.\
\
	some simpler and higher level ways of working with sound functions (see [
\f0\b AbstractPlayer]
\f1\b0 )\
\
	a Document like framework: 
\f0\b AbstractPlayer
\f1\b0 \
		with very few methods you can implement a subclass that can perform a specific\
		audio task, save itself to disk (making a backup) and reload itself.\
\
	an 
\f0\b Object Inspector
\f1\b0 : Insp to aid debugging and help learn more about SuperCollider itself.\
		also Class browser and optional graphical exception display.\

\f0\b\fs36 \cf0 INSTALLATION
\f1\b0 \
\

\fs24 crucial is distributed with SC and should not needed further installation.\
\
\
\
It is not advisable to use "the whole library".  Don't think of it as a single entity.  Try out one\
or two things and work them into what you are normally doing.  As time goes on, learn some more objects.\

\f1\b\fs36 Ref			a reference to a value
\f0\b0\fs24 \

\f1\b superclass: AbstractFunction
\f0\b0 \
\
A Ref  instance is an object with a single slot named 'value' that serves as a holder of \
an object. Ref.new(object) one way to create a Ref, but there is a syntactic shortcut. \
The backquote ` is a unary operator that is equivalent to calling Ref.new(something).
\
\
example:   \
\

\f2\fs18 \cf2 x = \cf3 Ref\cf2 .new(\cf3 nil\cf2 );\
z = obj.method(x);		\cf4 // method puts something in reference\
\cf2 x.value.doSomething;	\cf4 // retrieve value and use it
\fs24 \cf4 \
\cf0 \

\f0 Ref is also used as a quoting device to protect against multi channel expansion in certain UGens that require Arrays.\
\

\f1\b\fs28 \ul Class methods:\

\f0\b0\fs24 \ulnone \

\f1\b new(anObject)\

\f0\b0 \
create a Ref of an object.\
\

\f1\b `anObject\

\f0\b0 \
create a Ref of an object.\
\

\f1\b\fs28 \ul Instance methods:\

\f0\b0\fs24 \ulnone \

\f1\b value
\f0\b0 \
\
Answer the value.\
\

\f1\b value_(aValue)\

\f0\b0 \
set the value.\
\

\f1\b get
\f0\b0 \
\
Answer the value.\
\

\f1\b set(aValue)\

\f0\b0 \
set the value.\
\

\f1\b dereference
\f0\b0 \
\
Answer the value. This message is also defined in class Object where it just returns the receiver.  Therefore 
\f2 anything.dereference
\f0  will remove a Ref if there is one. This is slightly different than the value message, because value will also cause functions to evaluate themselves whereas dereference will not.\
\

\f1\b asRef
\f0\b0 \
\
Answers the receiver. In class Object this message is defined to create a Ref of the object.\

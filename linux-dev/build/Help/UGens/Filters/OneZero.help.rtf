\f1\b OneZero.ar(in, coef, mul, add)\

\f2\b0 \
A one zero filter. Implements the formula :\
\

\f0 out(i) = ((1 - abs(coef)) * in(i)) + (coef * in(i-1))\

\f2 \

\f1\b in
\f2\b0  - input signal to be processed\

\f1\b coef
\f2\b0  - feed forward coefficient. +0.5 makes a two point averaging filter (see also LPZ1), \
-0.5 makes a differentiator (see also HPZ1),  +1 makes a single sample delay (see also Delay1), \
-1 makes an inverted single sample delay. \

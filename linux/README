supercollider 3 server for linux (beta release)
-------------------------------------------------

intro
------

this is a port of james mccartney's supercollider synthesis engine (scsynth)
to linux. supercollider's main homepage is at

   http://www.audiosynth.com

the source code can be obtained via CVS from

   http://supercollider.sourceforge.net

requirements
-------------

 * gcc >= 3.0

   http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/

   gcc versions < 3.0 miss some required c++ features

 * ALSA + JACK

   http://www.alsa-project.org
   http://jackit.sourceforge.net

   you need the ALSA soundcard drivers and the JACK audio connection kit
   installed

 * libsndfile >= 1.0

   http://www.zip.com.au/~erikd/libsndfile

   _the_ soundfile i/o library

 * pkg-config >= 0.14.0

   facilitates checking for installed packages when compiling
   from source

 o autoconf >= 2.52, automake >= 1.4-p4, libtool >= 1.4.2a

   http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/
   http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/
   http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/

   when making changes to the build setup you'll need those too

installation
-------------

if you're familiar with building and installing linux packages, this won't
be new to you:

 * unpack the distribution tarball and change to the created directory
 o when building from the CVS sources, execute
   $ ./linux/bootstrap
 o for an overview of configuration options, execute
   $ ./configure --help
 * execute
   $ ./configure [options]
   $ make
   $ make install

note: unlike in previous releases, the jack audio driver doesn't need to be
enabled specifically, as it's the only currently implemented option on linux.

running
--------

run scsynth without options to get an option summary. don't forget to start
jackd before trying to use scsynth. if you want to add directories to
supercollider's search path or assign default jack ports, set up your
environment as described below.

environment
------------

the jack audio driver interface is configured based on various environment
variables:

 * SC_JACK_INPUTS (int, default 2) number of allocated jack inports

   $ export SC_JACK_INPUT=4

 * SC_JACK_OUTPUTS (int, default 2) number of allocated jack outports

   $ export SC_JACK_OUTPUTS=4

 * SC_JACK_DEFAULT_INPUTS (string) jack default inputs separated by ','

   $ export SC_JACK_DEFAULT_INPUTS="alsa_pcm:capture_1,alsa_pcm:capture_2"

 * SC_JACK_DEFAULT_OUTPUTS (string) jack default outputs separated by ','

   $ export SC_JACK_DEFAULT_OUTPUTS="alsa_pcm:playback_1,alsa_pcm:playback_2"

two additional environment variables add directories to the default search
path for plugins and synth definitions, respectively. directory names are
separated by ':' as in the unix PATH variable:

 * SC_PLUGIN_PATH, SC_SYNTHDEF_PATH

   $ export SC_SYNTHDEF_PATH="./synthdefs:/home/steve/lib/SuperCollider/synthdefs"

control
--------

start sclang from emacs (TODO: document that).

documentation
--------------

the hottest news and latest versions can be found at

   http://www.cs.tu-berlin.de/~kerstens/sc.html
   http://www.cs.tu-berlin.de/~kerstens/pub

there are various files describing the synthesis server and the language in
the 'build' subdirectory of the source package. if you have problems reading
rtf-files, conversions of some of the help files to html can be found at

   http://www.cs.tu-berlin.de/~kerstens/pub

known bugs
-----------

 * server crashes on '/quit' due to bug in AllocPool on linux

unknown bugs
-------------

PLEASE don't send bug reports concerning the linux port to the original
author of SuperCollider. direct them to the sc-dev mailing list or to me at
<steve@k-hornz.de>.

outro
------

thanks to james mccartney for this great piece of audio software, and to
andi pieper for build support on linux and macosx.

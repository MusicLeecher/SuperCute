SCEL -- SuperCollider/Emacs interface
------------------------------------------------------------------------

installation
-------------

put all *.el files in emacs' load-path. e.g. if you put them in
~/emacs/, add the following lines to ~/.emacs (or whatever your init
file is called):

(add-to-list 'load-path "~/emacs")

and then load the library:

(require 'sclang)

now put all *.sc files in sclang's library path, e.g. if you put them
in ~/SuperCollider/Emacs/, add the following to ~/.sclang.cfg:

+$HOME/SuperCollider/Emacs

you will also want to set the server program name, so add the
following to ~/.sclang.sc:

Server.program = "scsynth"

usage
------

in order to automatically start sclang when invoking emacs, use the
following command line:

$ emacs -sclang

you're now ready to edit, inspect and execute sclang code!

getting help
-------------

inside an sclang-mode buffer (e.g. by editing a .sc file), execute

C-h m

a window with key bindings in sclang-mode will pop up.

customization
--------------

to fine-tune the installation from within emacs' graphical
customization interface, type

M-x sclang-customize

in particular, you will have to customize `sclang-runtime-directory'
and `sclang-help-directory'.

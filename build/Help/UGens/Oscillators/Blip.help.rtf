\f0\b\fs36 \cf0 Blip			band limited impulse oscillator\
\

\fs24 Blip.ar(kfreq, knumharmonics, mul, add)\

\f1\b0 \
Band Limited ImPulse generator. All harmonics have equal amplitude.\
This is the equivalent of 'buzz' in MusicN languages. WARNING: This waveform in its raw form could be damaging to your ears at high amplitudes or for long periods.\
\
Implementation notes: \
It is improved from other implementations in that it will crossfade in a control period when the number of  harmonics changes, so that there are no audible pops. It also eliminates the divide in the formula by using a 1/sin table (with special precautions taken for 1/0).  The lookup tables are linearly interpolated for better quality.\
\
(Synth-O-Matic (1990) had an impulse generator called blip, hence that name here rather than 'buzz').\

\f0\b \
kfreq
\f1\b0  - frequency in Hertz\

\f0\b knumharmonics
\f1\b0  - number of harmonics. This may be lowered internally if it would cause aliasing.\

The enclosed documents are adapted from the 1st of 3 lectures on SuperCollider which I presented at the DSP SuperSchool at the International Academy of Media Art and Science in Ogaki City, Japan in February of 2004.

A Japanese version of the 1st lecture (translated by Shigeru Kobayashi) is also included.

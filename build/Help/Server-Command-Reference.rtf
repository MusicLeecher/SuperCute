The following is a list of all server commands and their arguments. \
If a command's description contains the word 
\f1\b Asynchronous
\f0\b0 , then that command will be passed to a background thread to complete so as not to steal CPU time from the audio synthesis thread. All asynchronous commands send a reply to the client when they are completed. \

\f1\b \cf0 n_free					delete a node.\

\f0\b0 	int - node ID\
	\
Stops the node abruptly, removes it from its group, and frees its memory.\
\

\f1\b /n_run					turn node on or off\

\f0\b0 	int - node ID\
	int - run flag\
	\
If the run flag set to zero then the node will not be executed.\
If the run flag is set back to one, then it will be executed.\
Using this method to start and stop nodes can cause a click if the node is not silent at the time run flag is toggled. \
\

\f1\b /n_set					set a node's control value(s)\

\f0\b0 	int - node ID\
	[\
		int or string - a control index or name\
		float - a control value\
	] * N\
	\
Takes a list of pairs of control indices and values and sets the controls to those values. If the node is a group, then it sets the controls of every node in the group.\
\

\f1\b /n_setn					set ranges of a node's control value(s)\

\f0\b0 	int - node ID\
	[\
		int or string - a control index or name\
		int - number of sequential controls to change (M)\
		[\
			float - a control value\
		] * M\
	] * N\
	\
Set contiguous ranges of control indices to sets of values. For each range, the starting control index is given followed by the number of controls to change, followed by the values. If the node is a group, then it sets the controls of every node in the group.\
\

\f1\b /n_fill					fill ranges of a node's control value(s)\

\f0\b0 	int - node ID\
	[\
		int or string - a control index or name\
		int - number of values to fill (M)\
		float - value\
	] * N\
	\
Set contiguous ranges of control indices to single values. For each range, the starting control index is given followed by the number of controls to change, followed by the value to fill. If the node is a group, then it sets the controls of every node in the group.\
\

\f1\b /n_map					map a node's controls to read from a bus\

\f0\b0 	int - node ID\
	[\
		int or string - a control index or name\
		int - control bus index\
	] * N\
	\
Takes a list of pairs of control names or indices and bus indices and causes those controls to be read continuously from a global control bus instead of responding to 
\f1\b n_set
\f0\b0 , 
\f1\b n_setn
\f0\b0  and 
\f1\b n_fill
\f0\b0  commands. If the node is a group, then it maps the controls of every node in the group. If the control bus index is -1 then any current mapping is undone and control reverts to normal.\
\

\f1\b /n_before					place a node before another\

\f0\b0 	int - the ID of the node to place (A)\
	int - the ID of the node before which the above is placed (B)\

\f1\b /n_after					place a node after another\

\f0\b0 	int - the ID of the node to place (A)\
	int - the ID of the node after which the above is placed (B)\
\
Places node A in the same group as node B, to execute immediately after node B.\

	\
Create a new synth from a synth definition, give it an ID, and add it to the tree of nodes. There are four ways to add the node to the tree as determined by the add action argument which is defined as follows:\

\f1\b add actions:
\f0\b0 \
	0 - add the new node to the the head of the group specified by the add target ID.\
	1 - add the new node to the the tail of the group specified by the add target ID.\
	2 - add the new node just before the node specified by the add target ID.\
	3 - add the new node just after the node specified by the add target ID.\
Controls may be set when creating the synth. The control arguments are the same as for the 
\f1\b n_set
\f0\b0  command.\
\

\f1\b /s_trace						trace unit generators inputs and outputs\

\f0\b0 	int - synth ID\
	\
Causes the synth to print out the values of the inputs and outputs of its unit generators for one control period.\

These messages are sent as notification of some event to all clients who have registered via the /notify command .\
\

\f1\b /n_go					a node was started\

\f0\b0 	int - node ID\
	int - group ID\
	int - prev node ID\
	int - next node ID\
	\
This command is sent to all registered clients when a node is created.\
\

\f1\b /n_end					a node ended\

\f0\b0 	int - node ID\
	int - group ID\
	int - prev node ID\
	int - next node ID\
	\
This command is sent to all registered clients when a node ends and is deallocated.\
\

\f1\b /n_off					a node was turned off\

\f0\b0 	int - node ID\
	int - group ID\
	int - prev node ID\
	int - next node ID\
	\
This command is sent to all registered clients when a node is turned off.\
\

\f1\b /n_on					a node was turned on\

\f0\b0 	int - node ID\
	int - group ID\
	int - prev node ID\
	int - next node ID\
	\
This command is sent to all registered clients when a node is turned on.\
\

\f1\b /n_move					a node was moved\

\f0\b0 	int - node ID\
	int - group ID\
	int - prev node ID\
	int - next node ID\
	\
This command is sent to all registered clients when a node is moved from one group to another.\
\

\f1\b /tr						a trigger message\

\f0\b0 	int - node ID\
	int - trigger ID\
	float - trigger value\
\
This command is the mechanism that synths can use to trigger events in clients.\
The node ID is the node that is sending the trigger. The trigger ID and value are determined by inputs to the SendTrig unit generator which is the originator of this message.\

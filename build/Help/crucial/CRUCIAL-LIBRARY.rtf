  \
Higher level interfaces for managing musical objects.\
\
	
\f0\b AbstractPlayer
\f1\b0 \
		This encapsulates things that play.  you can stop them, start them, record them and save them\
		to disk.  They handle all the messy details of loading their resources to the server, and getting\
		them off again when you are done.\
	\
	Patch\
		The most common and well known Player.  This patches inputs into a function.  Inputs can be floats,\
		other players, Envs (envelopes), Samples, or SFP (sound file player).\
		A Patch plays continously and infinitely (until you stop it).\
		\
	InstrSpawner, InstrGateSpawner\
		a Patch that plays successive events.  The inputs are taken as streams and interated.\
		\
	Interface\
		specify a player and interface elements and how they are connected.\
		allows custom gui and midi functions.\
		\
	introspection tools\
		.insp  -  a debugging tool\
			"any object".insp\
		class browser\
			AbstractPlayer.gui\
\
It is not advisable to use "the whole library"--don't think of it as a single entity.  Try out one or two things and work them into what you are normally doing;  as time goes on, learn some more objects.\
It should not be an all or nothing commitment.  If you perceive it as that, then you are approaching it wrong.\
\
Although there is a convienient system for instantly making guis for instrument functions, 
\f0\b the purpose of the library is not "a gui system".
\f1\b0   It is flexible, and can be used in any coding situation.\

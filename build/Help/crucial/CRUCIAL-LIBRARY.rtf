\f0\b\fs48 \cf0 CrucialLibrary
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\
This library offers:\
	complete compatibility with any and all Examples and other code libraries.\
\
	some simpler and higher level ways of working with sound functions (see [
\f0\b AbstractPlayer]
\f1\b0 )\
\
	many solutions for problems you may not realize exist yet\
		while there is a learning curve with this lib, it is a lot easier than trying to figure out\
		how to do this stuff "from scratch".  many people assume that this is some complex\
		system that they should wait until they have mastered "normal" super collider.\
		then they waste a month trying to get a Spawn to trigger from a button without getting yelled at \
		because the synth is not yet started or its over or you have the wrong number of channels,\
		and they never find out about [
\f0\b MonoSpawn
\f1\b0 ].\
		many of these solutions incorporate bug/gotcha fixes that you still haven't found out about,\
		and are soon going to post to the list asking if anyone knows why its doing that...\
		I just found one yesterday and incorporated the fix into [
\f0\b QuantizedScheduler
\f1\b0 ].\
		\
	many simple classes to combine with any other SC code you are working on.\
		any ugenFunction can be stuck inside a 
\f0\b FunctionPlayer
\f1\b0 , and you can play it with\
		
\f0\b PlayerPool
\f1\b0 , sequence it with 
\f0\b PlayerSeqTrack
\f1\b0  or 
\f0\b CyclePlayers
\f1\b0 .  Process it with\
		
\f0\b Patch
\f1\b0 , scale it with 
\f0\b CCPlugProxy
\f1\b0 .\
		You don't have to be "inside" some "cult system" to take advantage of individual classes.\
		It is very maleable and based on common and simple principles of functions.\
		None of the classes are dependant on the gui, they are all pure audio classes.\
		\
	a fast, powerful, simple and completely optional windowing system \
		see ([
\f0\b gui
\f1\b0 ] [
\f0\b FlowLayout
\f1\b0 ], [
\f0\b ObjectGui
\f1\b0 ], [
\f0\b AbstractPlayerGui
\f1\b0 ]).\
		you want to record ?  hit the record button.\
	\
	a Document like framework: 
\f0\b AbstractPlayer
\f1\b0 \
		with very few methods you can implement a subclass that can perform a specific\
		audio task, save itself to disk (making a backup) and reload itself.\
\
	an 
\f0\b ObjectInspector
\f1\b0  to aid debugging and help learn more about SuperCollider itself.\
		also Class browser and optional graphical exception display.\

\f0\b\fs36 INSTALLATION
\f1\b0 \
\

\fs24 Place the CrucialLibrary folder, or an alias of it in SCClassLibrary.\
\
Under the Lang menu, choose RecompileLibrary.\

\
It is not advisable to use "the whole library".  Don't think of it as a single entity.  Try out one\
or two things and work them into what you are normally doing.  As time goes on, learn some more objects.\

This library offers:\
\
	
\f0\b AbstractPlayer
\f1\b0 \
		This encapsulates things that play.  you can stop them, start them, record them and save them\
		to disk.  they handle all the messy details of loading their resources to the server, and getting\
		them off again when you are done.\

\
It is not advisable to use "the whole library".  Don't think of it as a single entity.  Try out one or two things and work them into what you are normally doing.  As time goes on, learn some more objects.\
It should not be an all or nothing commitment.  If you perceive it as that, then you are approaching it wrong.\
\
Although there is a convienient system for instantly making guis for instrument functions, the purpose of the library is not "a gui system".  It is flexible, and can be used in most any coding situation.\

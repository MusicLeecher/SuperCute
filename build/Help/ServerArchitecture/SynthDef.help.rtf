\f0\b\fs36 \cf0 SynthDef
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\
Evaluates a UGen function, generating a ugenGraph that describes \
the exact architecture of a Synth.  \
\
All constants, Controls, and UGens that will be used in synthesis are \
formatted for the Server and written to disk.  \

\f0\b \cf0 SynthDef(synthDefName,ugenGraphFunc)\

\f1\b0 	Create a synthDef instance, evaluate the ugenGraphFunc and build the ugenGraph.\
\
	Argument names that begin with "i_" will be static and non-modulatable.\
		they will not respond to /n_set or /n_map.\
	Other arguments are all Float inputs, representing either values or bus indices\
		for use in In or Out.\
	Functions inside of a SynthDef are evaluated only at the time of building \
		the ugenGraph.  Once the graph is built, it is a fixed architecture.\

\f0\b \
name
\f1\b0 \
	return my name.\
	a SynthDef is always referred to by its name, which should be unique.\

\f0\b \
writeDefFile
\f1\b0 \
	encode the graph into a file synthdefs/name.scsyndef\
\

\f0\b load(server, completionMessage)\

\f1\b0 	write the defFile and send a message to the server to load this file.\
	when this asynchronous command is completed, the completionMessage is evaluated\
\

\f0\b play(target, args, addAction)\

\f1\b0 	write the defFile and send a message to the server to load this file.\
	when this asynchronous command is completed, play one synth from this definition.\
	returns a synth object:\

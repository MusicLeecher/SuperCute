\
Concept of this library is to keep placeholders that\
can be modified while playing, so that writing code\
becomes an even closer part of musical practice.\
\
the main environment for this is\cf2  \cf0 [\cf2 ProxySpace\cf0 ]\
\
There is various classes that are used in this context that\
can be also useful:\
\
storing command settings:\cf2 	\cf0 [\cf2 NodeMap\cf0 ] [bundledCommands]\
special purpose Groups: 	[\cf2 Ensemble\cf0 ] [\cf2 ModelGroup\cf0 ] [\cf2 AbstractEnsemble\cf0 ]\
placeholders: 		[\cf2 NodeProxy\cf0 ]\cf2 [RecNodeProx\cf0 y][jitlib_efficiency]\

RECENT CHANGES:\
\
NodeProxy / ProxySpace:\
	put now has a different arg order! a.put(0, obj) or a[0] = obj\
	prependargs were removed for now.\
	lag can be set by name a.lag(\\freq, 1)\
	added granular / xtexture functionality: gspawner / spawner\
	a shortcut was added to efficiently read from another proxy: a.read(b) or a.read([b, c])\
\
	a.play now does not create multiple synths if evaluated repeatedly (unless multi: true)\
	lazy init works now.\
